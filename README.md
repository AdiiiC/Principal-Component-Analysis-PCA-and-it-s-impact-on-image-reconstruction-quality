# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-and-it-s-impact-on-image-reconstruction-quality
This project highlights effectiveness of PCA in reducing image data dimensionality and its impact on image reconstruction quality. It will provide insights into the balance between compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, demonstrating PCA's practical applications in image processing and data compression.
Objective:
To explore how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used for image compression and reconstruction, and to evaluate the impact of different numbers of principal components on the quality of reconstructed images.

Introduction:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible. In image processing, PCA can be applied to compress images by transforming the original image data into a set of principal components. These components capture the most significant features of the images, allowing for efficient storage and reconstruction.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection:

Collect a set of images to be used for the analysis. These images should be of the same size and format for consistency.
Preprocessing:

Convert the images to grayscale if they are in color to simplify the computation.
Flatten the 2D image matrices into 1D vectors to create a dataset suitable for PCA.
PCA Implementation:

Compute the mean image from the dataset.
Subtract the mean image from each image vector to center the data.
Compute the covariance matrix of the centered data.
Perform eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Sort the eigenvectors by the corresponding eigenvalues in descending order.
Select the top 
ùëò
k eigenvectors to form the principal components.
Image Compression:

Project the original image vectors onto the selected principal components to obtain compressed representations.
Image Reconstruction:

Reconstruct the images by transforming the compressed representations back to the original space using the selected principal components.
Evaluation:

Compare the original and reconstructed images using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSI).
Analyze the impact of different numbers of principal components on the quality of reconstructed images.
Expected Outcomes:

Dimensionality Reduction: Demonstrate how PCA reduces the dimensionality of image data while preserving important features.
Image Compression: Show how images can be compressed using a smaller number of principal components.
Reconstruction Quality: Evaluate the trade-off between the number of principal components used and the quality of the reconstructed images. As the number of principal components increases, the reconstruction quality should improve, but with diminishing returns.
Performance Metrics: Provide quantitative metrics (MSE, SSI) to objectively assess the reconstruction quality.
